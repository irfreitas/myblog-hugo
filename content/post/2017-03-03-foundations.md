Welcome to my blog. I hope to use this space to discuss social science research and to share what I learn about programming in R, Python, SQL, and other languages relevant to data science and computational social science methods.  I can't promise any deep wisdom, but hopefully I offer snippets of useful knowledge as I go along.

Cheers,
Isaac
